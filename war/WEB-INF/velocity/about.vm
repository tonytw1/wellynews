<p><i>Search $site_information.areaname</i> is ${site_information.areaname}'s own regional web directory.</p>
  
<p>The <i><a href="index#newslog">${site_information.areaname} Newslog</a></i>
draws in notices and newsitems published by local organisations. The resulting 
content isn't going to be what you'll find in a newspaper but we think that's 
half the attraction.</p>


<p>The Newslog appears daily on the front page of Search $site_information.areaname and is also available
as an <a href="feeds">RSS feed</a>. It is also possible to generate 
<a href="feeds#custom">custom RSS feeds</a> of content from specific organisations listed in the archive.</p>

<h3>Nikau Palms</h3>

<img src="/images/civic8.jpg" align="right"
alt="Nikau Palm in the Civic Square" />

<p><i>Right</i> - One of the copper clad Nikau palm trees which dot the 
<a href="tour?node=civic8">Civic Square</a> and line the exterior of the Central Library building.</p>

<p>
Valued at $25,000 NZ each, these
additions to the Square 
were suggested by the architect Ian Athfield as a way of making the area 
more inviting. The Nikaus have become somewhat of an icon for Wellington 
City.
</p>

<p>The Nikau, is a distinctive New Zealand native tree. Reassembling a 
feather duster, it grows to approximately 20ft.</p>

<p>The Nikau palm is found 
throughout New Zealand, growing as far south as Christchurch. While the trunk 
of this tree is of no use for building it's large leaves 
provided useful 
shelter for the early Maori, who also ate the young shots and buds. Wood 
Pigeons consume the berries in large quantities. The Nikau berry is 
extremely hard and was sometimes used as shotgun ammunition by early 
settlers.

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>This site uses a custom system to arregate and index local content. Here is
an overview of the system's features</p>

<h5>Listings</h5>

<p>The directory accepts four main categories of listing; websites, news items, feeds and watch list items.</p>

<p>A website represents a local organization's website. A news item is a link to a post or media release on a local site. 
A feed represents an RSS or ATOM feed. A watch list item represents a page which is know to content news items
which should be watched for updates (see news watch list below).</p>

<p>News items,  feeds and watchlist items can be assigned to their source website.
A website with has published other listings is referred to as a publisher.</p>


<h5>Tagging</h5>

<p>All listings can be tagged with Flickr style tags; these tags can be nested to form a  navigation tree.</p>


<h5>Types of pages</h5>

<p>Listings are displayed on several different types of page.</p>


<p><b>Tag pages</b><br/ >
Displays news items and websites with tagged with the given tag.</p>

<p>
ie. the <a href="/transport">transport tag page</a>.</p>
<p>
Tag pages also pull in all news items tagged with tags which are children of this tag
and news items from a publisher which is tagged with this tag.<p>

<p><b>Publisher pages</b><br />
Displays all news items from a given publisher.
</p>

<p><b>Combinations</b><br />
Returns newsitems tagged with a combination of two tags, or a publisher and a tag.
<p>
ie. all news items tagged with <a href="/transport+consultation">transport and consultation</a> and all news items 
<a href="/wellington-city-council+indoorsportscentre">Wellington City Council media releases tagged with indoor sports centre</a>.</p>



<h5>Automatically reading news items from feeds</h5>

<p>Submitted feeds are checked periodically for new news items by the feed reader.</p>

<p>Some feeds might be known to always contain good, relevant content; such as the local council's press release. Other feeds might contain mainly
internal interest only content which would not be of wider interest; ie. the universities' staff notices.</p>

<p>To control this decisions,  each feed has a feed acceptance policy which controls what todo with news items discovered in that feed.</p>

<p><b>Accept</b><br/>
Accept all news items from the feed and publish them immediately, if they
are dated within the last week.
</p>

<p><b>Accept even without dates</b><br/>
Accept and publish, even if no publication date is given.</p>

<p><b>Ignore</b><br/>
Do nothing.</p>

<p><b>Suggest</b><br/>
No not publish, but make a note of new items so that an editor may review them.
Suggestions appear in the feeds inbox where they await processing (see below).
</p>



<h5>Supressing feed news items</h5>

<p>News items in feeds may be supressed by url; suppressing prevents a feed newsitem
from been automatically expected in the future. Supressions can be used to prevent a
deleted news item been reimported by the feed reader.</p>


<h5>Feed autotagging</h5>
<p>
News items accepted from a feed are automatically tagged with the feed's tags, and any matching place names.
</p>


<h5>Feeds Inbox</h5>

<p>The <a href="/feeds/inbox">feed inbox</a> screen lists suspected news items which the feed reader has discovered in feeds
with an acceptance policy set to suggest.  Items in the inbox may be accepted or suppressed by an editor.</p>


<h5>The News Watchlist</h5>

<p>Many organizations who provide news items, do not provide feeds. The <a href="/watchlist">watchlist</a> attempts to monitor 
pages on these sites (say the news archive page) for changes, which could indicate new content.
The pages to be checked are entered into the system by an editor as watch list items.</p>

<p>The watchlist is exported as an RSS feed so that an editor can monitor it. All of the changed pages
may be opened at once using Firefox's 'open all in tabs' option.</p>



<h5>RSS feeds</h5>

<p>It's important that the local content you've aggregated and sorted is available for reuse by other community members.
To this end most pages are available as a RSS feed. Other local sites can take these feeds and display them on their sites without
having to undertake a complicated integration.</p>

<p>All of the main page types are available as an RSS or JSON feed.
The complete  range of available feeds is documented in the <a href="/api">API instructions</a>.</p>




<h5>Technical</h5>

<p>The system is implemented as an a Java / Spring application. Mysql And Solr provide the indexing functionality.</p>
