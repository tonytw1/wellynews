<p><i>Search $site_information.areaname</i> is ${site_information.areaname}'s own regional web directory.</p>
  
<p>The <i><a href="index#newslog">${site_information.areaname} Newslog</a></i>
draws in notices and newsitems published by local organisations. The resulting 
content isn't going to be what you'll find in a newspaper but we think that's 
half the attraction.</p>


<p>The Newslog appears daily on the front page of Search $site_information.areaname and is also available
as an <a href="feeds">RSS feed</a>. It is also possible to generate 
<a href="feeds#custom">custom RSS feeds</a> of content from specific organisations listed in the archive.</p>

<h3>Nikau Palms</h3>

<p><i>Right</i> - One of the copper clad Nikau palm trees which dot the Civic Square and line the exterior of the Central Library building.</p>

<p>
Valued at $25,000 NZ each, these
additions to the Square 
were suggested by the architect Ian Athfield as a way of making the area 
more inviting. The Nikaus have become somewhat of an icon for Wellington 
City.
</p>

<p>The Nikau, is a distinctive New Zealand native tree. Reassembling a 
feather duster, it grows to approximately 20ft.</p>

<p>The Nikau palm is found 
throughout New Zealand, growing as far south as Christchurch. While the trunk 
of this tree is of no use for building it's large leaves 
provided useful 
shelter for the early Maori, who also ate the young shots and buds. Wood 
Pigeons consume the berries in large quantities. The Nikau berry is 
extremely hard and was sometimes used as shotgun ammunition by early 
settlers.

<h3>Getting content out of the system</h3>

<p>By running an aggregator, we're taking a slight liberty with other peoples content.
It's therefore important we've transparent about what we're doing. To this end, our index is available in a machine readable form 
for reuse by other members of the community.

<p>ie. <a href="http://wellingtonista.com/">The Wellingtonista</a> and <a href="http://www.wcn.net.nz/">WCN</a> use our feed in to populate their Wellington news widgets.<p>

<p>Our ethos is, if we use a piece of data to render one of our own pages, then generally that data should also be available as a feed</p>


<h3>RSS and JSON feeds</h3>

<p>All of the main page types are available as an RSS or JSON feed. Appending /rss or /json to a site url
will in most cases provide the underlying data in the desired format. (credit - this url scheme is inspired by the Guardian newspaper's site)</p>

<p>The complete range of available feeds is documented in the <a href="/api">API instructions</a>.</p>
